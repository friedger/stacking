      <description>Update 27.10.2022: The conversion rate from xBTC to STX was wrongly calculated. We used the minimum STX amount of 57,160.867228, not the actual amount of 59,233.832647. Therefore, we distributed another round of rewards for pool members that received rewards in STX. Pool members receiving rewards in xBTC have received the correct amount in the first batch of distribution. The two xBTC transactions failed as expected. Boombox holders receive the correct amount in one transaction.</description>

      <description>We have received 5.26166854 BTC as rewards.&#xA;Hard times to Lock for #75The last cycle ended with network congestions due to slow miners and many transactions from STX20 activity. It was difficult to get all pool members into the next cycle. However, we managed to lock 43m STX. Some pools missed their final commit transaction and had to skip the cycle. Thanks to our self-service feature, we could lock early and try to add more members while new miners tried to clear the mempool.</description>

For this cycle, there were 40 transactions of 200 sats. This is something to keep in mind when doing accounting.&#xA;Rewards Part 1Once we received 2.</description>

      <description>We received 2.27728526 BTC as rewards.&#xA;Security NoticeThe recent incident at Alex showed how important security management is. Note, that Fast Pool does not manage your STX tokens. They stay in your wallet, with your private keys. Fast Pool manages BTC rewards from your stacking and distributes these in STX. We use different private keys, sponsored txs to reduce and other methods to reduce any risks for the rewards. Due to the incident, we did not use aBTC to wrap, instead we used simpleswap.</description>
