    "Friedger worked on the Android SDK back in 2018. Since then, Friedger has submitted many patches, test libraries and tools as they have become available. Friedger has developed Stacks apps, has mined Stacks earlier in 2022, and even deployed the [first user contract](https://explorer.stacks.co/txid/SP1K1A1PMGW2ZJCNF46NWZWHG8TS1D23EGH1KNK60.badges?chain=mainnet) on mainnet.",
    "Friedger is inspired by all work that helps to bring back a user-owned internet. Fast Pool is another step towards this vision.",
    "You can reach him on discord (friedger#0185) to provide feedback and ask questions.",
    "As delegatee, we cannot make any APY promises about the payouts. It depends on how much the miners transfer. We do not know in advance, but you can view stacking.club to get an idea and view [fastpool.org/payouts](https://fastpool.org/payouts) for historical data.",

    "No need to enter a BTC address anywhere as rewards distribution is in STX.",
    "Your STX token will lock immediately, you can increase the amount every cycle, you can revoke at any time and your STX tokens will unlock 1 day after the end of the cycle.",
    "For Leather Wallet Desktop users, you can use 'SP21YTSM60CAY6D011EZVEVNKXVW8FVZE198XEFFP.pox-fast-pool-v2' as pool address. (Yes, it is a contract). You need to use version 4.10 or later.",

    "Please do not stack less than 40 STX. Small payouts are hard to manage.",
