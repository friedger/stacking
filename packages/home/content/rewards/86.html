<p>We received 3.75284 BTC as rewards.</p>
<h3>Payout in STX and BTC</h3>
<p>
  We introduced a distribution flow in BTC on individual requests. The BTC
  rewards were split proportionally.
</p>
<p>For cycle 86, we used</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>1.31639870 BTC for BTC distribution and</p></li>
  <li><p>2.43644129 BTC for STX distribution.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Dust transactions</h3>
<p>
  There are many dust rewards of 200 sats and 550 sats. We ignore these utxos
  because consolidating them is more expensive then their value. That means that
  a few sats will rest in the pox reward address. For this cycle, there were
  76,400 sats left in the wallet after reward distribution. This is something to
  keep in mind when doing accounting.
