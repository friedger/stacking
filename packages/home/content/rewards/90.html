<p>We received 3.41614 BTC as rewards.</p>
<h3>Payout in STX and BTC</h3>
<p>
  We introduced a distribution flow in BTC on individual requests. The BTC
  rewards were split proportionally.
</p>
<p>
  For cycle 90, we used this flow only for the first distribution of the cycle
</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>0.58233765 BTC for BTC distribution and</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>
      1.55510424 BTC for STX distribution for the first part of the
      distribution.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Dust transactions</h3>
<p>
  There are many dust rewards of 200 sats. We ignore these utxos usually.
  However, some dust utxos were spent during the second distribution. This was
  due to a new distribution process and will be fixed for the next cycles.
</p>

<h3>Liquid Stacking With LISA</h3>
<p>
  This cycle, the Liquid Stacking service LISA with FAST Pool as part of Lisaâ€™s
  backend delegated 1,740,000 STX to Fast Pool. Lisa used 5 smart contract as
  pool members. The share of Lisa was 5.984850% of the STX part of the pool.
</p>
<p>The rewards were distributed with the normal distribution flow:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      3,534.085596 STX:

<h3>Consolidation and Swapping</h3>
<p>
  After 1 week, we consolidated the rewards until then, a total of 2.170741 BTC
  and distributed 0.58233765 BTC to pool members who registered for BTC rewards
  and 0.03064935 BTC to the Fast Pool reserve. The remaining 1.55509426 BTC were

  One week after the end of the cycle, we consolidated the remaining rewards of
  1.245399 BTC. The total amount of 1.25236934 BTC were swapped to 42,802.1353
  STX. An extra 0.00856600 BTC was added due to the late distribution and an
  unlucky coin selection that included BTC rewards from cycle #91. These will be
  returned from Fast pool treasury for rewards of cycle #91.
</p>
<p>
  The late distribution was caused by the new distribution process. To
  compensate for the late distribution, we have not deducted any fees and added
  a 5% bonus of 2,140.106765 STX for this second distribution.
</p>
<p>
  32,235.734013 STX were distributed to pool members receiving rewards in STX
  and 12,706.508052 STX to pool members receiving rewards in BTC that were
  exceptionally distributed in STX.

<h3>Total Rewards</h3>
<p>
  A total of 91,286.255984 STX were distributed to 652 pool members and 5
  contracts. The distribution was based on 29,073,406.954268 STX stacked to
  receive STX rewards.
</p>
<p>
  If all BTC rewards for pool members receiving BTC rewards were distributed the
  total would have been 0.91755212 BTC. However, only 0.58233765 BTC were
  distributed in BTC, the remainder was distributed in STX, and 12,706.508052
  STX were send to 1 pool member. The distribution was based on 11,459,999 STX
  stacked to receive BTC rewards.
</p>
<p>
  If all BTC rewards were distributed as STX rewards the total would have been
  127,268.980813 STX based on 35,617,832.532583 STX stacked.
</p>

<h3>Preparing for Nakamoto Release (2.5% reserve)</h3>
<p>
  This year, the Nakamoto hard fork will bring sBTC. This means that we will
  wrap BTC to sBTC, then exchange to STX and distribute.
</p>
<p>
  However, stackers need to do more work eventually, run stacks and a signer
  node. We successfully started to be signer for Stacks 2.5 and are registered
  since cycle #84 as signer. We voted during cycle #90 for an initially
  simplified implementation of block signing.
</p>
<p>
  For cycle #90, we transferred

    >3,053.932329 STX</a
  >
  from STX distribution and 0.03064935 BTC from BTC distribution to the reserve
  (see above). That is a around than 2.5% of the theoretical total STX rewards
  after converting BTC to STX at the exchange rate of 2676 sats/stx
  (2,80,746,360 sats / 104,906.5896 STX).

<h3>Swapping using simpleswap</h3>
<p>
  Swapping using simpleswap is not as transparent as using aBTC via Xlink
  bridge. Therefore, here is a screenshot with the exchange ids:
