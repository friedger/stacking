### Distribution in sBTC and Stacking for a Cause

We continued to distribute rewards in sBTC and to distribute parts of rewards to curated projectsfor for users who registered during delegation to Fast Pool v2.

For cycle #116, three user chose to receive sBTC and five users chose to give a share to ZeroAuthority DAO.

These users were mainly testing version 2 of fastpool.org. For the next cycles, these options will be made more accessible.

The total amount of 0.00376899 sBTC was distributed. The sBTC tokens were swapped via bitflow for 654.5 STX. In the future, we want to use app.stacks.co. However, their minimum amount is 0.01 sBTC.

### Consolidation and Swapping

We consolidated the rewards address continuously and transferred a total of 1.09540805 BTC to the proxy address.

We distributed 0.20199214 BTC to pool members who registered for BTC rewards and 0.04936770 BTC to the Fast Pool reserve (fees for all pool members, 4.5%).

The remaining BTC of 0.84404821 BTC were swapped to 144,808.81598 STX in 1 transactions using Binance 24h TWPA.
