### Distribution in sBTC and Stacking for a Cause

We continued to distribute rewards in sBTC and to distribute parts of rewards to curated projectsfor for users who registered during delegation to Fast Pool v2.

For cycle #117, five user chose to receive sBTC and six users chose to give a share to ZeroAuthority DAO.

These users were mainly testing version 2 of fastpool.org. For the next cycles, these options will be made more accessible.

The total amount of 0.00445152 sBTC was distributed. The sBTC tokens were swapped via bitflow for 774 STX. In the future, we want to use app.stacks.co. However, their minimum amount is 0.01 sBTC.

### Consolidation and Swapping

We consolidated the rewards address continuously and transferred a total of 1.01860269 BTC to the proxy address.

We distributed 0.18856293 BTC to pool members who registered for BTC rewards and 0.04590922 BTC to the Fast Pool reserve (fees for all pool members, 4.5%).

The remaining BTC of 0.78412747 BTC were swapped to 136,558.082786 STX in 1 transactions using over the counter swap.
