<p>We received 5.05206500 BTC as rewards.</p>

<h3>Payout in STX and BTC</h3>
<p>
  We introduced a distribution flow in BTC on individual requests. The BTC
  rewards were split proportionally.
</p>
<p>For cycle 94, we used</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>1.11179467 BTC for BTC distribution and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>3.94027032 BTC for STX distribution.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Dust transactions</h3>
<p>
  Currently, the wallet does not contain any dust transactions. They were
  consolidated accidentially in the first consolidation of cycle 93.
</p>

<h3>Liquid Stacking With LISA</h3>
<p>
  This cycle, the Liquid Stacking service LISA with FAST Pool as part of Lisaâ€™s
  backend delegated 1,260,000 STX to Fast Pool. Lisa used 3 smart contract as
  pool members. The share of Lisa was 3.096360% of the STX part of the pool.
</p>
<p>The rewards were distributed with the normal distribution flow:</p>
<ul>
  {{% tolisa stx="2,082.932943"
  stxtx="0xd8568fc339a42af5dcc4da556256c5e650c1b780c620b6274fa61007da9ce578" %}}

</ul>

<h3>Total Rewards</h3>
<p>
  A total of 132,524.986548 STX were distributed to 729 pool members and 5
  contracts. The distribution was based on 40,692,934.629964 STX stacked to
  receive STX rewards.
</p>
<p>
  A total of 1.05620493 BTC were distributed to 1 pool member from the proxy btc
  address. The distribution was based on 11,482,001 STX stacked to receive BTC
  rewards.
</p>
<p>
  If all BTC rewards were distributed as STX rewards the total would have been
  169,918.506114 STX based on 52,174,935.629964 STX stacked.
</p>

<h3>Preparing for Nakamoto Release (4.3% reserve)</h3>
<p>
  This year, the Nakamoto hard fork will bring sBTC. This means that we will
  wrap BTC to sBTC, then exchange to STX and distribute.
</p>
<p>
  However, stackers need to do more work eventually, run stacks and a signer
  node. We successfully started to be signer for Stacks 2.5 and are registered
  since cycle #84 as signer. We completed the first cycle handover between cycle
  #92 and #93.
</p>
<p>
  For cycle #94, we transferred

  from STX distribution and 0.05550393 BTC from BTC distribution to the reserve
  (see above). That is 7.388,807886 STX or around 4.3% of the theoretical total
  STX rewards after converting BTC to STX at the exchange rate of 2973 sats/stx
  (3,94,027,032 sats / 132,524.986548 STX).
