<h3>Compensation as Stacks Signer after Nakamoto Release (5.0% reserve)</h3>
<p>
  This was the third cycle after the Nakamoto hard fork. We run successfully a
  signer that continously signes Stack blocks. Our signer runs at a good health
  level. We setup a sBTC signer on testnet and are preparing the sBTC signer for
  mainnet.
