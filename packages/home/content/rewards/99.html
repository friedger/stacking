<p>We received X BTC as rewards.</p>

<h3>Payout in STX and BTC</h3>
<p>
  The BTC rewards were split proportionally to pool members registered for
  rewards in STX, the default, and for rewards in BTC.
</p>
<p>For cycle 99, we used</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>X BTC for BTC distribution and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>X BTC for STX distribution.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Dust transactions</h3>

  Currently, the wallet contains 1200 sats in dust transactions of 400 sats.
</p>

<h3>Liquid Stacking With LISA</h3>

  This cycle, the Liquid Stacking service LISA with FAST Pool as part of Lisaâ€™s
  backend delegated 1,410,000 STX to Fast Pool. Lisa used 3 smart contract as
  pool members.

<p>The rewards were distributed with the normal distribution flow:</p>

<h3>Compensation as Stacks Signer after Nakamoto Release (5.0% reserve)</h3>
<p>
  This was the third cycle after the Nakamoto hard fork. We run successfully a
  signer that continously signes Stack blocks. Our signer runs at a good health
  level. We setup a sBTC signer on testnet and are preparing the sBTC signer for
  mainnet.
