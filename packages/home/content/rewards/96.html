<h3>Total Rewards</h3>
<p>
  A total of 156,173.213777 STX were distributed to 746 pool members and 7
  contracts. The distribution was based on 41,552,393.215034 STX stacked to
  receive STX rewards.
</p>
<p>
  A total of 0.97118793 BTC were distributed to 1 pool member from the proxy btc
  address. The distribution was based on 11,482,001 STX stacked to receive BTC
  rewards.
</p>
<p>
  If all BTC rewards were distributed as STX rewards the total would have been
  199,327.912171 STX based on 53,034,394.215034 STX stacked.
</p>

<h3>Compensation as Stacks Signer after Nakamoto Release (4.7% reserve)</h3>
<p>
  This was the first cycle after the Nakamoto hard fork. We run successfully a
  signer that continously signes Stack blocks. We coordinate closely with the
  Stacks team that monitors the signers behaviour. We responded quickly to new
  version updates and best practice recommendations. Our signer runs at a good
  health level.

    >3,180.172555 STX</a
  >
  from STX distribution and 0.02482980 BTC from BTC distribution to the reserve
  (see above) of the first distribution. For the second distribution, we
  transferred the fees in BTC only (0.12140981, see above). The total
  corresponds to 9,340.223523 STX or around 4.7% of the theoretical total STX
  rewards after converting BTC to STX at the exchange rate of 2374 sats/stx
  (3,70,783,835 sats / 156,173.213777 STX).
