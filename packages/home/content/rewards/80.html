<p></p><p>We have received 2.055507 BTC as rewards.</p><h3>Dust transactions</h3><p>There are many dust rewards of 200 sats and 550 sats. We started to ignore these utxos because consolidating them is more expensive then their value. That means that a few sats will rest in the pox reward address. For this cycle, there were 79,000 sats left in the wallet after reward distribution. This is something to keep in mind when doing accounting.</p><h3>Consolidation Part 1</h3><p>After 1 week, we</p><p>consolidated 1.7090399 BTC (0.0063051 BTC fees) to proxy address:</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://mempool.space/tx/7ff6b4da14007eb477f58119eb96f347f847685fae81f4d2737ddc54d8c718d3">https://mempool.space/tx/7ff6b4da14007eb477f58119eb96f347f847685fae81f4d2737ddc54d8c718d3</a></p><h3>Consolidation Part 2</h3><p>After the cycle, we</p><p>consolidated 0.33889256 BTC (0.00121744 BTC fees) to proxy address: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://mempool.space/tx/75e7cca89fc15ae72f619a749f0236013bb7c9f9d8f542061c94326337275a6e">https://mempool.space/tx/75e7cca89fc15ae72f619a749f0236013bb7c9f9d8f542061c94326337275a6e</a></p><h3>Total Rewards</h3><p>After the consolidation we swapped</p><p>1.945541 BTC to 36,644.767 STX via aBTC:</p><p>a) BTC to swap pool: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://mempool.space/tx/b98569c884d449e575534a02e497a39516c51d49f8f42897dd15d9a4381de8cb">https://mempool.space/tx/b98569c884d449e575534a02e497a39516c51d49f8f42897dd15d9a4381de8cb</a></p><p>b) swap pool to STX: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://explorer.hiro.so/txid/0x30122ee42406e70d14f9778c58b08c16291c8ad29e2d8a703984206654d42b4f?chain=mainnet">https://explorer.hiro.so/txid/0x30122ee42406e70d14f9778c58b08c16291c8ad29e2d8a703984206654d42b4f?chain=mainnet</a></p><p>A total of 36,644,766,247 STX were distributed to 1437 pool members and 2 contracts. The distribution was based on 47,527,379.553 STX.</p><h3>Preparing for Nakamoto Release (5% reserve)</h3><p>This year, the Nakamoto hard fork will bring sBTC. This means that we will replace aBTC with sBTC. The flow will be similar: wrapping to sBTC, then exchanging to STX and distributing.</p><p>However, stackers need to do more work eventually, run stacks and a signer node. We are preparing for that and put around 5% of the rewards aside. We started to build up infrastructure and it will allow us to operate Stacks 3.0 signer nodes.</p><p>For cycle #80, we sent 0.1022963 <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://mempool.space/tx/28d0533dbd401e8e11cd2e85a507d94659d4523b87c09ad76ef1bef192108724">https://mempool.space/tx/28d0533dbd401e8e11cd2e85a507d94659d4523b87c09ad76ef1bef192108724</a> to the reserve. That is around 5% of the consolidated BTC rewards.</p><h3>Wrapping using aBTC</h3><p>The rewards were wrapped from BTC to STX via aBTC. This worked quite well and fast. It is transparent and minting aBTC happens automagically.
