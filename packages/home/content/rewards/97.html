<h3>Total Rewards</h3>
<p>
  A total of 168,801.253023 STX were distributed to 758 pool members and 6
  contracts. The distribution was based on 51,981,030.973358 STX stacked to
  receive STX rewards.
</p>
<p>
  A total of 0.81705766 BTC were distributed to 1 pool member from the proxy btc
  address. The distribution was based on 11,482,001 STX stacked to receive BTC
  rewards.
</p>
<p>
  If all BTC rewards were distributed as STX rewards the total would have been
  206,087.473009 STX based on 63,463,031.973358 STX stacked.
</p>

<h3>Compensation as Stacks Signer after Nakamoto Release (4.7% reserve)</h3>
<p>
  This was the second cycle after the Nakamoto hard fork. We run successfully a
  signer that continously signes Stack blocks. We coordinate closely with the
  Stacks team that monitors the signers behaviour. We responded quickly to new
  version updates and best practice recommendations. Our signer runs at a good
  health level.
</p>
<p>
  For cycle #97, we transferred 0.23768531 BTC from BTC distribution to the
  reserve (see above). The total corresponds to 10,293.8635773 STX or around
  5.0% of the theoretical total STX rewards after converting BTC to STX at the
  exchange rate of 2309 sats/stx (3,89,869,002 sats / 168,801.253023 STX).
