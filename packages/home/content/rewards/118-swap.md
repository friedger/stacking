### Distribution in sBTC and Stacking for a Cause

We continued to distribute rewards in sBTC and to distribute parts of rewards to curated projectsfor for users who registered during delegation to Fast Pool v2.

For cycle #118, five user chose to receive sBTC and six users chose to give a share to ZeroAuthority DAO.

These users were mainly testing version 2 of fastpool.org. For the next cycles, these options will be made more accessible.

The total amount of 0.00606896 sBTC was distributed. The sBTC tokens were swapped via bitflow for 1,141.711 STX. In the future, we want to use app.stacks.co, now, that the cap is lifted and the minimum decreased.

### Consolidation and Swapping

We consolidated the rewards address continuously and transferred a total of 1.26935272 BTC to the proxy address.

We distributed 0.23623109 BTC to pool members who registered for BTC rewards and 0.05721390 BTC to the Fast Pool reserve (fees for all pool members, 4.5%).

The remaining BTC of 0.97590773 BTC were swapped to 182,628.255834 STX in 1 transactions over the counter.
