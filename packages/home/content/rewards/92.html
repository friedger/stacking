<p>We received 5.00645000 BTC as rewards.</p>
<h3>Payout in STX and BTC</h3>
<p>
  We introduced a distribution flow in BTC on individual requests. The BTC
  rewards were split proportionally.
</p>
<p>For cycle 92, we used</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>1.10111557 BTC for BTC distribution and</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>3.90533442 BTC for STX distribution.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Dust transactions</h3>
<p>
  There are many dust rewards of 200 sats. We ignore these utxos because
  consolidating them is more expensive then their value. That means that a few
  sats will rest in the pox reward address. For this cycle, there were 59,800
  sats left in the wallet after reward distribution. This is something to keep
  in mind when doing accounting.
</p>

<h3>Liquid Stacking With LISA</h3>
<p>
  This cycle, the Liquid Stacking service LISA with FAST Pool as part of Lisaâ€™s
  backend delegated 1,640,000 STX to Fast Pool. Lisa used 4 smart contract as
  pool members. The share of Lisa was 4.027179n% of the STX part of the pool.
</p>
<p>The rewards were distributed with the normal distribution flow:</p>
<ul>
  <li>

<h3>Total Rewards</h3>
<p>
  A total of 142,830.8079 STX were distributed to 691 pool members and 6
  contracts. The distribution was based on 40,723,294.500169 STX stacked to
  receive STX rewards.
</p>
<p>
  A total of 1.04507615 BTC were distributed to 1 pool member from the proxy btc
  address. The distribution was based on 11,482,001 STX stacked to receive BTC
  rewards.
</p>
<p>
  If all BTC rewards were distributed as STX rewards the total would have been
  183,102.193092 STX based on 52,205,295.500169 STX stacked.

<h3>Preparing for Nakamoto Release (3.9% reserve)</h3>
<p>
  This year, the Nakamoto hard fork will bring sBTC. This means that we will
  wrap BTC to sBTC, then exchange to STX and distribute.
</p>
<p>
  However, stackers need to do more work eventually, run stacks and a signer
  node. We successfully started to be signer for Stacks 2.5 and are registered
  since cycle #84 as signer. We completed the first cycle handover between cycle
  #92 and #93.
</p>
<p>
  For cycle #92, we transferred

  (see above). That is a around 3.9% of the theoretical total STX rewards after
  converting BTC to STX at the exchange rate of 2734 sats/stx (3,90,533,442 sats
  / 142,830.807900 STX).

  to the Fast Pool reserve.
</p>
<p>
  The last swap request was rejected by Simpleswaps. Therefore, we used the
  over-the-counter swap of catamaran swaps on https://jing.cash. It is a two
  step process where we did a deposit of 409.83 STX and then sent the agreed btc
  amount. The UI failed and the swapping partner did claim the deposit and then
  send the agreed STX amount plus the deposit. Therefore, the total amount in
  the stx transaction is 14,070.89 STX (13,661 + 409.83).
</p>
<p>
  Swapping using simpleswap is not as transparent as using aBTC via Xlink
  bridge. Therefore, here is a screenshot with the exchange ids:
