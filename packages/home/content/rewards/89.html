<p>We received 3.8046 BTC as rewards.</p>
<h3>Payout in STX and BTC</h3>
<p>
  We introduced a distribution flow in BTC on individual requests. The BTC
  rewards were split proportionally.
</p>
<p>For cycle 89, we used</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>1.17067769 BTC for BTC distribution and</p></li>
  <li><p>2.63392230 BTC for STX distribution.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Dust transactions</h3>
<p>
  There are many dust rewards of 200 sats. We ignore these utxos because
  consolidating them is more expensive then their value. That means that a few
  sats will rest in the pox reward address. For this cycle, there were 76,400
  sats left in the wallet after reward distribution. This is something to keep
  in mind when doing accounting.
</p>

<h3>Liquid Stacking With LISA</h3>
<p>
  This cycle, the Liquid Stacking service LISA with FAST Pool as part of Lisaâ€™s
  backend delegated 1,709,999 STX to Fast Pool. Lisa used 5 smart contract as
  pool members. The share of Lisa was 6.632017% of the STX part of the pool.
</p>
<p>The rewards were distributed with the normal distribution flow:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      6,180.583606 STX:

<h3>Consolidation and Swapping</h3>
<p>
  After 1 week, we consolidated the rewards until then, a total of 2.09256956
  BTC.
</p>
<p>
  At the end, we consolidated the remaining rewards of 1.70703622 BTC and
  distributed 1.1106839 BTC to pool members who registered for BTC rewards and
  0.05845704 BTC to the Fast Pool reserve. The remaining 2.63043546 BTC were
  swapped to 98,098.015 STX.

<ul>

      2.09256956 to proxy (after 1 week):

<h3>Total Rewards</h3>
<p>
  A total of 93,193.113939 STX were distributed to 612 pool members and 5
  contracts. The distribution was based on 25,783,994.241795 STX stacked to
  receive STX rewards.
</p>
<p>
  A total of 1.1106839 BTC were distributed to 1 pool member from the proxy btc
  address. The distribution was based on 11,459,999 STX stacked to receive BTC
  rewards.
</p>
<p>
  If all BTC rewards were distributed as STX rewards the total would have been
  134,613.888164 STX based on 37,243,993.241795 STX stacked.
</p>

<h3>Preparing for Nakamoto Release (5.2% reserve)</h3>
<p>
  This year, the Nakamoto hard fork will bring sBTC. This means that we will
  wrap BTC to sBTC, then exchange to STX and distribute.
</p>
<p>
  However, stackers need to do more work eventually, run stacks and a signer
  node. We successfully started to be signer for Stacks 2.5 and are registered
  since cycle #84 as signer.
</p>
<p>
  For cycle #89, we transferred

    >4,904.90075 STX</a
  >
  from STX distribution and 0.05845704 BTC from BTC distribution to the reserve
  (see above). That is a around than 5.2% of the theoretical total STX rewards
  after converting BTC to STX at the exchange rate of 2826 sats/stx
  (2,63,043,546 sats / 98,098.015 STX).

<h3>Swapping using simpleswap</h3>
<p>
  Swapping using simpleswap is not as transparent as using aBTC via Xlink
  bridge. Therefore, here is a screenshot with the exchange ids:
