<p>We received 5.318425 BTC as rewards.</p>
<h3>Payout in STX and BTC</h3>
<p>
  We introduced a distribution flow in BTC on individual requests. The BTC
  rewards were split proportionally.
</p>
<p>For cycle 91, we used</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>1.18171076 BTC for BTC distribution and</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>4.13671423 BTC for STX distribution.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Dust transactions</h3>
<p>
  There are many dust rewards of 200 sats. We ignore these utxos because
  consolidating them is more expensive then their value. That means that a few
  sats will rest in the pox reward address. For this cycle, there were 59,800
  sats left in the wallet after reward distribution. This is something to keep
  in mind when doing accounting.
</p>

<h3>Liquid Stacking With LISA</h3>
<p>
  This cycle, the Liquid Stacking service LISA with FAST Pool as part of Lisaâ€™s
  backend delegated 1,640,000 STX to Fast Pool. Lisa used 4 smart contract as
  pool members. The share of Lisa was 4.088038% of the STX part of the pool.
</p>
<p>The rewards were distributed with the normal distribution flow:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      6,034.838138 STX:

<h3>Consolidation and Swapping</h3>
<p>
  At the end of the cycle, we consolidated the rewards in 3 transactions because
  there were too many reward inputs to fit into a single consolidation
  transactions. Therefore, we split it in two. Then we consolidated the
  remaining inputs after the end of the cycle. We distributed 1.12262522 BTC to
  1 pool member who registered for BTC rewards and 0.05908553 BTC to the Fast
  Pool reserve. The remaining 4.13671423 BTC were swapped to 152,187.48964 STX
  and 147,621.86495 STX were distributed to 682 pool members.

<h3>Total Rewards</h3>
<p>
  A total of 147,621.86495 STX were distributed to 677 pool members and 5
  contracts. The distribution was based on 40,117,042.559387 STX stacked to
  receive STX rewards.
</p>
<p>
  A total of 1.12262522 BTC were distributed to 1 pool member from the proxy btc
  address. The distribution was based on 11,459,999 STX stacked to receive BTC
  rewards.
</p>
<p>
  If all BTC rewards were distributed as STX rewards the total would have been
  189,792.132666 STX based on 51,577,041.559387 STX stacked.
</p>

<h3>Preparing for Nakamoto Release (3.5% reserve)</h3>
<p>
  This year, the Nakamoto hard fork will bring sBTC. This means that we will
  wrap BTC to sBTC, then exchange to STX and distribute.
</p>
<p>
  However, stackers need to do more work eventually, run stacks and a signer
  node. We successfully started to be signer for Stacks 2.5 and are registered
  since cycle #84 as signer. We voted during cycle #90 for an initially
  simplified implementation of block signing.
</p>
<p>
  For cycle #91, we transferred

    >4,565.624689 STX</a

  from STX distribution and 0.05908553 BTC from BTC distribution to the reserve
  (see above). That is a around than 3.5% of the theoretical total STX rewards
  after converting BTC to STX at the exchange rate of 2718 sats/stx
  (4,13,671,423 sats / 152,187.48964 STX).

<h3>Swapping using simpleswap</h3>
<p>
  Swapping using simpleswap is not as transparent as using aBTC via Xlink
  bridge. Therefore, here is a screenshot with the exchange ids. Two swaps are
  missing because one was done via the simpleswap api (ejv3q9mojldsb6tr) and one
  accidentially as an anonymous user:
