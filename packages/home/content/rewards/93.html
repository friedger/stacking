<p>We received 5.79150000 BTC as rewards.</p>
<h3>Payout in STX and BTC</h3>
<p>
  We introduced a distribution flow in BTC on individual requests. The BTC
  rewards were split proportionally.
</p>
<p>For cycle 93, we used</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>1.26906392 BTC for BTC distribution and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>4.52243607 BTC for STX distribution.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Dust transactions</h3>
<p>
  Currently, the wallet does not contain any dust transactions. They were
  consolidated accidentially in the first consolidation of cycle 93.
</p>

<h3>Liquid Stacking With LISA</h3>
<p>
  This cycle, the Liquid Stacking service LISA with FAST Pool as part of Lisaâ€™s
  backend delegated 1,640,000 STX to Fast Pool. Lisa used 4 smart contract as
  pool members. The share of Lisa was 4.008088% of the STX part of the pool.
</p>
<p>The rewards were distributed with the normal distribution flow:</p>
<ul>
  {{% tolisa stx="2,863.122221"
  stxtx="0xdc6153371de352f34bc94fc6311040afdbb4540e72c50f590495bac42b1183c5" %}}

</ul>

  distributed 0.64623097 BTC to pool members who registered for BTC
  rewards and 0.03401215 BTC to the Fast Pool reserve. The 0.95% of the
  remaining 2.45262668 BTC (=2.32999534 BTC) were swapped to 82,167.681775 STX.
  The amount of 82,167.681418 STX was distributed to the 725 pool members who

<h3>Total Rewards</h3>
<p>
  A total of 153,601.284823 STX were distributed to 719 pool members and 6
  contracts. The distribution was based on 40,917,257.404609 STX stacked to
  receive STX rewards.
</p>
<p>
  A total of 1.20475144 BTC were distributed to 1 pool member from the proxy btc
  address. The distribution was based on 11,482,001 STX stacked to receive BTC
  rewards.
</p>
<p>
  If all BTC rewards were distributed as STX rewards the total would have been
  196,704.127432 STX based on 52,399,258.404609 STX stacked.
</p>

<h3>Preparing for Nakamoto Release (3.8% reserve)</h3>
<p>
  This year, the Nakamoto hard fork will bring sBTC. This means that we will
  wrap BTC to sBTC, then exchange to STX and distribute.
</p>
<p>
  However, stackers need to do more work eventually, run stacks and a signer
  node. We successfully started to be signer for Stacks 2.5 and are registered
  since cycle #84 as signer. We completed the first cycle handover between cycle
  #92 and #93.
</p>
<p>
  For cycle #93, we transferred

  (see above).That is 5349,288043 STX or around 3.8% of the theoretical total STX rewards after
  converting BTC to STX at the exchange rate of 2944 sats/stx (4,52,243,607 sats
  / 153,601.284823 STX).

  swapping after the second consolidation. Therefore, the fees are lower.

    >refunded</a
  >. This happened shortly before the deadline for reward distribution that is
  implemented for Lisa. Therefore, we swapped the missing amount of 0.32999534
  BTC using 11,427.021048 STX from the Fast Pool reserve at the rate of 2887.
  This corresponded to the exchange rate of coingecko at the time.

<p>
  Swapping using simpleswap is not as transparent as using aBTC via Xlink
  bridge. Therefore, here is a screenshot with the exchange ids using the
  simpleswap UI. (The remaining swaps were created via their Rest API):
