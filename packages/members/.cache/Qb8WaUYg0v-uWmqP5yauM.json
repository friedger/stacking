We started to ignore these utxos because consolidating them is more expensive then their value. That means that a few sats will rest in the pox reward address. For this cycle, there were 73,800 sats left in the wallet after reward distribution. This is something to keep in mind when doing accounting.</p><h3>Consolidation Part 1</h3><p>After 1 week, we</p><ul><li><p>consolidated 1.0691993 BTC (0.0049907 BTC fees) to proxy address: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://mempool.space/tx/fe6654d8b2804e7daae23fd2e7a9bfe3886cc05750b09316acce9b32953d9556\">https://mempool.space/tx/fe6654d8b2804e7daae23fd2e7a9bfe3886cc05750b09316acce9b32953d9556</a></p></li></ul><h3>Consolidation Part 2</h3><p>After the cycle, we</p><ul><li><p>consolidated 1.09101615 BTC (0.00489385 BTC fees) to proxy address: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://mempool.space/tx/142089d0eb78797fb9bbb68f76330fd85ea2c105879e2a019a8568a7d5bc345f\">https://mempool.space/tx/142089d0eb78797fb9bbb68f76330fd85ea2c105879e2a019a8568a7d5bc345f</a></p></li></ul><h3>Total Rewards</h3><p>After the consolidation, we swapped</p><p>2.05221 BTC to 46,036.768179 STX via aBTC:</p><ul><li><p>a) BTC to swap pool: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://mempool.space/tx/9a4ef1b1216dcd44e0939de8d7b4010526b73147eb8b029c9001812546eb77c7\">https://mempool.space/tx/9a4ef1b1216dcd44e0939de8d7b4010526b73147eb8b029c9001812546eb77c7</a></p></li><li><p>b) swap pool to STX: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://explorer.hiro.so/txid/0xef73a1a0ae2ec6a10f72e73a35d90220db9f6428e4780ffbcdb726d0d820d97c?chain=mainnet\">https://explorer.hiro.so/txid/0xef73a1a0ae2ec6a10f72e73a35d90220db9f6428e4780ffbcdb726d0d820d97c?chain=mainnet</a></p></li></ul><p>A total of 46,036.767486 STX were distributed to 1441 pool members and 2 contracts.

This means that we will replace aBTC with sBTC. The flow will be similar: wrapping to sBTC, then exchanging to STX and distributing.</p><p>However, stackers need to do more work eventually, run stacks and a signer node. We are preparing for that and put around 5% of the rewards aside. We started to build up infrastructure and it will allow us to operate Stacks 3.0 signer nodes.</p><p>For cycle #79, we sent <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://mempool.space/tx/fea9050fec217a74385938b0af7ec82c035b678797aaa24bbed0379fce947577\">0.10790486 BTC</a> to the reserve. That is around 5% of the consolidated BTC rewards.</p><h3>Wrapping using aBTC</h3><p>The rewards were wrapped from BTC to STX via aBTC. This worked quite well and fast. It is transparent and minting aBTC happens automagically.
