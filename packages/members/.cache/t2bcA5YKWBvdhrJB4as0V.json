We started to ignore these utxos because consolidating them is more expensive then their value. That means that a few sats will rest in the pox reward address. Fpr this cycle, there were 63,600 sats left in the wallet after reward distribution. This is something to keep in mind when doing accounting.</p><h3>Consolidation Part 1</h3><p>After 1 week, we</p><ul><li><p>consolidated 1.26685100 BTC - 0.00571096 BTC fees to proxy address:<br><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://mempool.space/tx/630ec976a7b4e7128b9f4fb8f8fd585735b57690f1232f808cb23d485cbad942\">https://mempool.space/tx/630ec976a7b4e7128b9f4fb8f8fd585735b57690f1232f808cb23d485cbad942</a></p></li></ul><h3>Consolidation Part 2</h3><p>After the cycle, we consolidated  BTC</p><ul><li><p>consolidated 0.82955000 BTC - 0.00308700 fees to proxy address: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://mempool.space/tx/d747801133cef576b0341e6f1e478b488867c0a96712cfe1a23cf4b02eb17918\">https://mempool.space/tx/d747801133cef576b0341e6f1e478b488867c0a96712cfe1a23cf4b02eb17918</a></p></li></ul><h3>Total Rewards</h3><p>After the second consolidation we swapped </p><ul><li><p>1.98325756 BTC to 39,478.70139 STX via aBTC:<br>a) BTC to swap pool: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://mempool.space/tx/096f4a6deb415bdfb538a318478d387ff84be3957101f71b18f5ab966209d86e\">https://mempool.space/tx/096f4a6deb415bdfb538a318478d387ff84be3957101f71b18f5ab966209d86e</a><br>b) swap pool to STX: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://explorer.hiro.so/txid/0x4ce0cab78edb700f9dd24f3c4e58beaee9f757083f1a0baa3ebb294ef591abc2?chain=mainnet\">https://explorer.hiro.so/txid/0x4ce0cab78edb700f9dd24f3c4e58beaee9f757083f1a0baa3ebb294ef591abc2?chain=mainnet</a></p></li></ul><p>A total of 39,478.700719 STX were distributed to 1360 pool members and 2 contracts.

This means that we will replace aBTC with sBTC.

That is around 5% of the consolidated BTC rewards. Unfortunately, a dust output was created due to an issue with the wallet.</p><h3>Wrapping using aBTC</h3><p>The rewards were wrapped from BTC to STX via aBTC. This worked quite well and fast. It is transparent and minting aBTC happens automagically.
