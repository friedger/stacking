<p><strong>Update: </strong>The article has been updated to reflect v2 of Fast Pool. The stacking contract address pox-2 has been changed to pox-3. The Fast pool contract has been changed from -v1 to -v2.</p><h2>Rules of Fast Pool</h2><p>Friedger Pool has been renamed to Fast Pool. Fast Pool stand for Friedger Autonomous Self-Service Trust Pool.</p><p>The pool operator of Friedger Pool is a smart contract. Pool operations can be done by any user. The rules are written in the contract:</p><ul><li><p>Your STX are locked for 1 cycle at a time. (With this new smart contract pool, your STX is no longer locked for specific amount of time (3, 6 or 12 cycles) and it is simply delegated until you revoke delegation. Your STX will unlock after the end of the following cycle.)</p></li><li><p>You can always increase the delegation amount for the next cycle.</p></li><li><p>You have to lock your STX for every cycle. If you don’t do it half way through the cycle, friends, family or automation scripts can do it for you.</p></li><li><p>This continues until you end membership (revoke delegation) or until you join a different pool.</p></li><li><p>There is always 1 STX that is not locked to allow you to leave the pool with a revoke-delegation contract call.</p></li></ul><p><s>The address of the pool (v1) is: </s><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://explorer.stacks.co/txid/0xe76bed450308e50b69507d4b7bd483c8c6b525ae0f24f137e9c359a1208bfa1c?chain=mainnet"><s>SP21YTSM60CAY6D011EZVEVNKXVW8FVZE198XEFFP.pox-fast-pool-v1</s></a></p><p>The address of the pool (v2) is: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://explorer.hiro.so/txid/SP21YTSM60CAY6D011EZVEVNKXVW8FVZE198XEFFP.pox-fast-pool-v2?chain=mainnet">SP21YTSM60CAY6D011EZVEVNKXVW8FVZE198XEFFP.pox-fast-pool-v2</a></p><p>Always check the latest information on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://pool.friedger.de">pool.friedger.de</a></p><p>Risks:</p><ul><li><p>The pool does not reach the locked amount for at least 1 reward slot: Your STX do not earn rewards for 1 cycle.</p></li><li><p>BTC rewards are not distributed: This is unchanged and requires the same trust as before. Some improvements will come hopefully.</p></li></ul><h2>Self-Service: Delegate and Lock in 1 Transaction</h2><p>The general principal is that you do the following:</p><p><strong>A) Allow the pool contract to handle your stacking</strong>. This need to be done only once per pool contract.</p><p><strong>B-1) Delegate STX to the pool and lock them.</strong> This needs to be done at least once and can be done every cycle if you want to increase your amount or lock again.</p><p><strong>B-2) Lock STX only for you or other users.</strong> This can be done for all cycles after B-1 was done.</p><h3>Use Stacking web app lockstacks.com</h3><p>The web app can be used with Leather (previously <s>Hiro)</s> Wallet (and Ledger) or Xverse wallet.</p><ol><li><p>Visit <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="http://lockstacks.com">lockstacks.com</a> or on mobile <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://stacks://browser?url=lockstacks.com">stacks://browser?url=lockstacks.com</a>.</p></li><li><p>Select FAST pool</p></li><li><p>Enter the amount you want to delegate</p></li><li><p>Select “Indefinite duration”</p></li><li><p>Read the terms and conditions</p></li><li><p>Make a contract call to pox-3 contract to allow the Fast Pool contract to handle your stacking.
