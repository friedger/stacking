      <description>The Challenge A startup called Cope hired me to create a minimum viable product for their new idea — tracking mental health. It was the first project where I handled mobile app design, and I was very excited to learn the intricacies of the iOS platform.
My clients John and Kat have done some preliminary interviews with psychologists and psychiatrists to get their side of the picture. They have established a user persona, a business model canvas, and several startup prep work for the product to take off.</description>

      <description>Context The Ateneo Junior Marketing Association always outsourced their website development to different organizations in the university. This year, they chose User Experience Society, the organization I founded to create a strong digital presence for their flagship event. TEDxADMU is acclaimed among the youth and is marked by the many up and coming trailblazers in the Philippine community.
The Challenge TEDxADMU always faced the same problems every year. How can we elevate the number of applications we receive?</description>
